# Undergraduate Thesis

This repository contains code developed for my undergraduate thesis at the Department of Physics, Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU).

The project involves the application of Monte Carlo methods to simulate and solve a physics-based computational problem, with exploration into integrating machine learning techniques.

> ⚠️ This is a personal academic project and is under active development. The code and documentation are not intended for public reuse or academic referencing at this time.

**Note:** This repository is shared as part of a thesis process report. For questions or further details, please feel free to contact me directly.
